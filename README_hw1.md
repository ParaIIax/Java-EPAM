# Java-EPAM HW 1
Task 1.
For a given integer n calculate the value which is equal to a:
•  squared number, if its value is strictly positive;
•  modulus of a number, if its value is strictly negative;
•  zero, if the integer n is zero.
Example,
n = 4     result =  16
n = -5    result =  5
n = 0     result = 0

Task 2. Find the maximum integer, that can be obtained by permutation of
numbers of an arbitrary three-digit positive integer n (100<=n<=999).
Example,
n =165          result =  651

Task 3.
For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of  n.
Example,
n = 1234     result = 4
n = 246      result = 0

Task 4.
For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the amount of the “1” in the binary
representation of n.
Example,
n = 14 (10) = 1110 (2)              result =  3
n = 128 (10) = 1000 0000 (2)        result  =  1
